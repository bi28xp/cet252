his project does not work as intended. 

However, the API should partially run if you download it and use either postman or chromium and go to http://localhost:5000 having first used "node app.js" to initialise the file. You can then go to http://localhost:5000/testjson or http://localhost:5000/quote to test some of it out.

I searched high and low online in order to find a way to develop a client to fulfil the same functionality Postman did. I could not make head nor tail of any of the tutorials: they used concepts I wasn’t familiar with, and I was barely even able to attempt to create a client. My API is designed to run with Postman and the bit of code in this folder is all I have for the client side of things. 

Furthermore, the API part of the assignment has failed. Although the basic “/”, “/testjson”, and “/quote” tests do work, for some reason the database “protein” does not load in when called. I have spend around 10 hours on the API documentation and trying to get the endpoints to actually work, to no avail. I have looked on the internet but have no idea why they aren’t working. 

Lastly, I was unable to upload my project to Github using “push” and “pull”. It threw errors each time, and I could not figure out how to get it to load. 

Thank you for reading: I have submitted early as I am heavily behind on another module and will need to work solidly for a month just on that to stand a chance of passing it.
